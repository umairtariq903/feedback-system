First of place this code in your local xampp/wampp server.
create a mysql database with the name as "feedback-system"
run "php artisan migrate" in command prompt/git bash
run "php artisan db:seed" to insert admin in database
After the above setup
run "npm install"
run "npm run dev"
And when npm run dev is running, in new tab
run "php artisan serve"



Note: I have uploaded vendor and node modules folder on github just to make sure , you don't have to run composer install. This project runs on php 8.2
